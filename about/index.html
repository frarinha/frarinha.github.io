            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Currently working as a freelance videographer. Stories are how we learn, communicate and remember. I have always been fascinated by the power of moving pictures, and I&rsquo;m grateful for being able to make a living by sharing my creations. Although making films is one of my biggest passions, I think it would suit better as a hobby. At the moment, I&rsquo;m seeking to transition to the InfoSec field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a <em>Penetration Testing</em> position.</p>
<p>I have been around computers since I can remember. My first computer ran <em>windows 98</em> and I mostly used it to play games and write gibberish in text editors. Pressing keys on a keyboard and seeing symbols appear on a screen felt like magic at the time. This quickly turned into an interest in video games, that were a big part of my childhood.</p>
<p>Although naturally creative, I&rsquo;m also a very curious person. At the time, I thought that science was the best way to find answers to understand the world. So, in my academic journey I pursued sciences and technologies. In university I learned about computer systems, programming and networks. Despite the fact that I have a good understanding of how computers work, it still feels like magic to me.</p>
<p>Hacking is about finding a way to outsmart a system using it&rsquo;s own features to our advantage. There&rsquo;s nothing more fun than that. Funny enough, hacking computer systems also meets my creative side. I find hacking very similar to art. <em>Capture the flag</em> challenges are a big part of my learning methodology because I&rsquo;m a very hands-on learner. Basically they&rsquo;re puzzles that teach you how to break into computer systems.</p>

<p><strong>TryHackMe Profile</strong>

<p>Since I have the most fun on the offensive side of these challenges, <em>Penetration Tester</em> seems like the most adequate role for my profile. Other interests in the security field include reverse engineering, red teaming, intrusion detection, incident response and security architecture.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for somebody to fill that position, here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://kafkaesc.com/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from hacking, I have multiple other interests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hacking the body</strong> 💪 - I exercise daily to keep my body healthy and functional. Mostly calisthenics.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking the mind</strong> 🧠 - I have a bit of an ADHD brain, so now and again I&rsquo;ll take some time to meditate and practice my mindfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking my behavior</strong> 💡 - I&rsquo;ve developed important habits and routines that keep me productive and effective.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking my diet</strong> 🍴 - I&rsquo;ve created low calorie recipes that are delicious and satiating. No need to be hungry on a diet. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post some of them here.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking people</strong> 👥 -  I have worked in sales and I like to read about the principles of influence.  I am interested in understanding what moves people, how to make friends and make better negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking the planet</strong> 🌍</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>📘 Currently reading:</strong> <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em></p>
