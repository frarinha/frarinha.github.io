                <p>Currently working as a freelance <strong>videographer</strong>. Stories are how we learn, communicate and remember. I have always been fascinated by the power of moving pictures, and I&rsquo;m grateful for being able to make a living by sharing my creations. Although making films is one of my biggest passions, I think it would suit better as a hobby. At the moment, I&rsquo;m seeking to transition to the InfoSec field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a <strong>Penetration Testing</strong> position.</p>
<p>My background is in computer science, I studied <em>Informatics Engineering</em> in university. <em>Information Technology</em> is a very big field composed of multiple ever-expanding sub-fields that are all interlaced with each other. An <em>hacker</em> can&rsquo;t really afford to neglect these sub-fields, because an attack can occur at all levels. I&rsquo;m a generalist myself, so this holistic approach to IT fits like a glove.</p>
<p>Hacking is about finding a way to outsmart a system using it&rsquo;s own features to our advantage. There&rsquo;s nothing more fun than that ‚Äî silly computers. Funny enough, hacking computer systems also meets my creative side. I find hacking very similar to art.</p>
<p><strong>Capture the flag</strong> challenges are a big part of my learning methodology because I&rsquo;m a very hands-on learner. Basically they&rsquo;re puzzles that teach you how to break into computer systems.</p>

<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Since I have the most fun on the offensive side of these challenges, <em>Penetration Tester</em> seems like the most adequate role for my profile. If you&rsquo;re looking for somebody to fill that position, here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://kafkaesc.com/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Other interests in the security field include reverse engineering, red teaming, intrusion detection, incident response and security architecture.</p>
<p>Apart from hacking, I have multiple other interests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hacking the body</strong> üí™ - I exercise daily to keep my body healthy and functional. Mostly calisthenics.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking the mind</strong> üß† - I have a bit of an ADHD brain, so now and again I&rsquo;ll take some time to meditate and practice my mindfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking my behavior</strong> üí° - I&rsquo;ve developed important habits and routines that keep me productive and effective.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking my diet</strong> üç¥ - I&rsquo;ve created low calorie recipes that are delicious and satiating. No need to be hungry on a diet. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post some of them here.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking people</strong> üë• -  I have worked in sales and I like to learn about the principles of influence.  I am interested in understanding what moves people, how to make friends and make better negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking the planet</strong> üåç</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>üìò Currently reading:</strong> <em>G√∂del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em></p>
